# hello-world
Just another repository


I am Ale and I am here to learn about Github and social coding!
I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Economics (the ufficial name is Socio-Economic and Statistical Studies, but to make it a little bit more understandable, we simply call it "Applied Eononomics").
My interest for github was born the moment I joined a course of Data Mining at Sapienza, the University where I study. The istructor strongly suggested us to view gh to learn more about social coding and learning sharing.
